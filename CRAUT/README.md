`CRAUT` is a pure geometrical analysis tool for generating linkers according to a rod & angle model. It was coded in Python within a very short timeframe; it is by no means optimized for runtime and can take several hundred hours for the complete analysis.

We therefore advice You to look at your protein in a 3d visualizing tool and try to connect the termini with rods and angles. Then translate this by hand to the sequences found on our wiki. This will save You a lot of time and might yield just as accurate results.

The `CRAUT` repo was built during wiki freeze; therefore it is not as well documented as it should be. Please excuse this.
