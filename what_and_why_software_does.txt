Weighing function:

all parts of the weighing function should be indipendent of amount of points in the protein and the size of the protein. In the end, one would like to have a weighing of the different parts (length, angles, ... ) that is valid for every protein. Therefore:
-length is normed by distance from beginning to the end of the protein
-unprefereable_places is indipendent of the amount of the places the user defines. But it is not weighed by anything else
-distances is weighed by the minimum, so the path with the best distances on one connection produces 1. This is beacuse if the protein is of a shape, that the distance has to become really large, it shouldn't be bad for the paths. Best path produces always the same number.
-angles is indipendent of protein and if there is one angle less then it is also the best value. There is a seperate function, where the weighing of each angle can be defined.

Evaluation of Linkers:

For evaluation of valuability of proteins, there are two factors: G and B factor.

-B-factor is used to tell how flexible a part from Crystal structure is, this might be nice for us to see in the angles. It is a measured value from PDB generation. The higher B-factor is, the more flexible the part is. 

-G-factor is a value, that tells you, whether a aminoacid is in it's natural conformation. There are programs, like gfac2pdb , that insert in the PDB's B-factor column the G-factor, see [1]. The higher the G-factor is, the worse the conformation is.
